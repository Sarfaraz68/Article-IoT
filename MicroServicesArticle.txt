Microservices architecture or simply known as microservices is a collection of services that are loosely coupled and can be managed easily. 

Furthermore, these services can be tested and deployed independently. Microservices architecture is a practice of breaking an application into smaller and independent components which can communicate through an API interface.

Before The Emergence Of Microservices
=====================================
In the beginning of software development only highly qualified people could write a computer programme. In 1964 BASIC language was developed which made programme-writing easy for less qualified people. Therefore in the 1960s software began to become lengthy and complex. The computer scientist introduced a modular approach to overcome complexity of the programmes. In 1972 the concept of modularity introduced which led to Modular software development. This concept consists of decomposing large/lengthy code of softwares into loosely coupled and highly cohesive modules that made  sure that one module should focus on single functionality.
